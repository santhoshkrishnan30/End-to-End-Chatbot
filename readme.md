# End-to-End Chatbot using Python
What is an End to End Chatbot?
An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. To create an end-to-end chatbot, you need to write a computer program that can understand user requests, generate appropriate responses, and take action when necessary. This involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users. 

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself. To create an end-to-end chatbot using Python, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

Define Intents
Create training data
Train the chatbot
Build the chatbot
Test the chatbot
Deploy the chatbot
